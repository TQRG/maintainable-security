This occurs because axis2server.sh adds the root directory of the binary distribution to the class path, and SimpleHTTPServer doesn't limit the search for XSD/WSDL files to the service class loader. This means that axis2.xml is accessible remotely via a specially crafted query string (xsd=../conf/axis2.xml).

Although AxisServlet is not known to be vulnerable, this change also modifies ListingAgent to limit the search to the service class loader.

Shore up some of the implementation gaps we have around nonces. Nonces
should expire and should be generated by the server. I've followed the
Symfony approach to generating nonces which results in short lived (5
minutes by default) nonces that are regenerated each time the client
receives a 401.

By validating and requiring nonce rotation we can avoid replay attacks
with our Digest authentication implementation.

I've targetted 3.next as validating/requiring nonce rotation is
a behavior change that I feel could trip up application developers. By

Leak detection (e.g., by running with ""--leak"") used to have a devastating
effect on the performance of the checked program, which although was
tolerable (for leak detection, long runs are often unnecessary), it was
still annoying.

While before this patch leak-detection runs were roughly 5 times slower
than regular runs, after this patch they are only about 40% slower than
a regular run! Read on for the details.

The main reason for this slowness was a simplistic vector which was used to
keep the records for currently living allocations. This vector was linearly
searched both for free spots (to remember new allocations) and for specific
addresses (to forget freed allocations). Because this list often grew to a
hundred thousand of items, it became incredibly slow and slowed down the
whole program. For example, getting a prompt from cli.jar happened in 2
seconds without leak detection, but in 9 seconds with leak detection.

A possible solution would have been to use an O(1) data structure, such as
a hash table. This would be complicated by our desire to avoid frequent
memory allocation inside the leak detector, or our general desire to avoid
complicated stuff in the leak detector because they always end leading to
complicated deadlocks :-)

This patch uses a different approach, inspired by an idea by Guy.

It still uses an ordinary vector for holding the records, but additionally
keeps for each record one ""next"" pointer which is used for maintaining two
separate lists of records:

1. A list of free records. This allows a finding a record for a new
   allocation in O(1) time.

2. A list of filled records, starting with the most-recently-filled record.
   When we free(), we walk this list and very often finish very quickly,
   because malloc() closely followed by free() are very common.
   Without this list, we had to walk the whole vector filled with ancient
   allocations and even free records, just to find the most recent
   allocation.

Two examples of the performance with and without this patch:

1. Getting a prompt from cli.jar takes 2 seconds without leak detection,
   9 seconds with leak detection before this patch, and 3 seconds with this
   patch.

2. The ""sunflow"" benchmark runs 53 ops/second without leak detection,
   which went down to 10 ops/second with leak detection before this patch,
   and after this patch - 33 ops/second.

I verified (by commenting out the search algorithm and always using the
first item in the vector) that the allocation record search is no longer
having any effect on performance, so it is no longer interesting to replace
this code with an even more efficient hash table. The remaining slowdown is
probably due to the backtrace() operation and perhaps also the tracker lock.",8ffe45bf0e00b4b95140ea9aa6035d71f90a86ee,"['cc', 'hh']",,e87ca49ffe9201bd42d594fc45781ca6b718d26a,43badb47ad71888f98bf7924c6a4763aa909ac9f,FOUND,-160316.67337300477,-160348.52272938902,31.849356384249404,-386331.62100422435,-386428.626301021,97.0052967966767,-787881.7290307656,-787913.7290307656,32.0,-126330.21428571426,-126362.21428571426,32.0,-449353.4324324324,-449385.4324324324,32.0,-335782.79088357097,-335814.79088357097,32.0,5794.500000000029,5762.500000000029,32.0,192955.55390665997,192926.065639614,29.488267045962857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,283763.0,283731.0,32.0

As reported in issue #580 (and also earlier in issue #374), sometimes OSv
crashes during a call to exit(), with the message ""exception nested too
deeply"" usually printed. The ""shutdown"" REST API can probably cause
a similar issue, though this was not reported in practice.

The problem is that exit(), calling osv::shutdown(), forcibly unmounts the
filesystem, but other threads might still be running code from executables
mapped from files. If these threads happen to run after osv::shutdown()
unmounts the filesystem but before it powers off the VM, they can cause
OSv to crash, a crash which is usually accompanied by a ""exception nested
too deeply"" message, as the page-fault handler itself crashes.

A complete solution of this problem is difficult - in Unix it is usually
solved by killing all user processes before unmounting the filesystem,
but in OSv we have no reliable method of killing threads. The closest
approximation is what I do in this patch - use thread::unsafe_stop()
to stop all application threads (presumably, these would be the threads
running code from the filesystem).

This technique will usually work - in particular it eliminates the crashes
reported in issue #580. But is not an entirely reliable solution - if an
application thread happens to hold a critical OSv mutex while it is stopped,
this can deadlock the entire system. This should be a rare problem (a
reasonable application is unlikely to call exit() while its other threads are
busy doing important work), but we should nevertheless re-consider this
workaround in the future.

One idea we can consider is not to preemptively stop the application
threads before unmounting (as we do in this patch). Instead, we can leave
these threads running, and in the page-fault handler code recognize
this case (the backing file has been unmounted), and stop this thread
only at at that point. It still remains to be seen whether that technique
can completely avoid deadlocks (theoretically, we can be holding a mutex
while a page fault happens...) or other types of horrible crashes.

Fixes #580.
Fixed #374.

Protocols (IMAP, POP3 and SMTP) that use the path part of a URL in a
decoded manner now use the new Curl_urldecode() function to reject URLs
with embedded control codes (anything that is or decodes to a byte value
less than 32).

URLs containing such codes could easily otherwise be used to do harm and
allow users to do unintended actions with otherwise innocent tools and
applications. Like for example using a URL like
pop3://pop3.example.com/1%0d%0aDELE%201 when the app wants a URL to get

When negotiating SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication, the function
Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() uses the data provided from the
server without doing the proper length checks and that data is then
appended to a local fixed-size buffer on the stack.

This vulnerability can be exploited by someone who is in control of a
server that a libcurl based program is accessing with POP3, SMTP or
IMAP. For applications that accept user provided URLs, it is also
thinkable that a malicious user would feed an application with a URL to
a server hosting code targetting this flaw.

Security problem: CVE-2013-2174

If a program would give a string like ""%FF"" to curl_easy_unescape() but
ask for it to decode only the first byte, it would still parse and
decode the full hex sequence. The function then not only read beyond the
allowed buffer but it would also deduct the *unsigned* counter variable
for how many more bytes there's left to read in the buffer by two,
making the counter wrap. Continuing this, the function would go on
reading beyond the buffer and soon writing beyond the allocated target
buffer...

== Summary ==

In PyCrypto before v2.6.1, the Crypto.Random pseudo-random number
generator (PRNG) exhibits a race condition that may cause it to generate
the same 'random' output in multiple processes that are forked from each
other.  Depending on the application, this could reveal sensitive
information or cryptographic keys to remote attackers.

An application may be affected if, within 100 milliseconds, it performs
the following steps (which may be summarized as ""read-fork-read-read""):

1. Read from the Crypto.Random PRNG, causing an internal reseed;
2. Fork the process and invoke Crypto.Random.atfork() in the child;
3. Read from the Crypto.Random PRNG again, in at least two different
   processes (parent and child, or multiple children).

Only applications that invoke Crypto.Random.atfork() and perform the
above steps are affected by this issue.  Other applications are
unaffected.

Note: Some PyCrypto functions, such as key generation and PKCS#1-related
functions, implicitly read from the Crypto.Random PRNG.

== Technical details ==

Crypto.Random uses Fortuna[1] to generate random numbers.  The flow of
entropy looks something like this:

    /dev/urandom  -\
                    +-> ""accumulator"" --> ""generator"" --> output
    other sources -/   (entropy pools)     (AES-CTR)

- The ""accumulator"" maintains several pools that collect entropy from
  the environment.

- The ""generator"" is a deterministic PRNG that is reseeded by the
  accumulator.  Reseeding normally occurs during each request for random
  numbers, but never more than once every 100 ms (the ""minimum reseed
  interval"").

When a process is forked, the parent's state is duplicated in the child.
In order to continue using the PRNG, the child process must invoke
Crypto.Random.atfork(), which collects new entropy from /dev/urandom and
adds it to the accumulator.  When new PRNG output is subsequently
requested, some of the new entropy in the accumulator is used to reseed
the generator, causing the output of the child to diverge from its
parent.

However, in previous versions of PyCrypto, Crypto.Random.atfork() did
not explicitly reset the child's rate-limiter, so if the child requested
PRNG output before the minimum reseed interval of 100 ms had elapsed, it
would generate its output using state inherited from its parent.

This created a race condition between the parent process and its forked
children that could cause them to produce identical PRNG output for the
duration of the 100 ms minimum reseed interval.

== Demonstration ==

Here is some sample code that illustrates the problem:

    from binascii import hexlify
    import multiprocessing, pprint, time
    import Crypto.Random

    def task_main(arg):
        a = Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes(8)
        time.sleep(0.1)
        b = Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes(8)
        rdy, ack = arg
        rdy.set()
        ack.wait()
        return ""%s,%s"" % (hexlify(a).decode(),
                          hexlify(b).decode())

    n_procs = 4
    manager = multiprocessing.Manager()
    rdys = [manager.Event() for i in range(n_procs)]
    acks = [manager.Event() for i in range(n_procs)]
    Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes(1)
    pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=n_procs,
                                initializer=Crypto.Random.atfork)
    res_async = pool.map_async(task_main, zip(rdys, acks))
    pool.close()
    [rdy.wait() for rdy in rdys]
    [ack.set() for ack in acks]
    res = res_async.get()
    pprint.pprint(sorted(res))
    pool.join()

The output should be random, but it looked like this:

    ['c607803ae01aa8c0,2e4de6457a304b34',
     'c607803ae01aa8c0,af80d08942b4c987',
     'c607803ae01aa8c0,b0e4c0853de927c4',
     'c607803ae01aa8c0,f0362585b3fceba4']

== Solution ==

The solution is to upgrade to PyCrypto v2.6.1 or later, which properly
resets the rate-limiter when Crypto.Random.atfork() is invoked in the
child.

This patch strenghten the DSA signing code against
side-channel attacks.

The DSA signing formulae:

r = (g^{k} mod p) mod q
s = k^{-1} * (H(m) + r*x) mod q

becomes:

b = random in [1..q)
r = (g^{k} mod p) mod q
s = (b * k)^{-1} * (b*H(m) + r*(b*x)) mod q

In this way we avoid that the secret (x) gets multiplied
by a random factor (r) which is immediately disclosed
to an attacker (which we assume can both collect (r) and
also monitor the side-channel produced by the multiplication).

There are three things that, when combined, produce exploitably-weak random
number generation reminiscent of the infamous Debian libssl fiasco
(CVE-2008-0166):

    1. Microsoft Windows

    2. A long-standing bug in PyCrypto's setup.py that omits the ""winrandom""
       module from the build procedure, causing RandomPool to be seeded weakly
       when it is instantiated.

    3. A tendency among PyCrypto's users to (incorrectly) treat RandomPool as
       a portable substitute for reading from /dev/urandom.  RandomPool was
       never intended as a complete RNG, but I have seen several cases where
       it has been treated as one. (See footnote.)

This commit provides a quick fix for #2.  Future work will attempt to fix #3 by
providing users with a ""works out-of-the-box"" random number generation API.
Fixing #1 probably won't happen any time soon, though reports of the initial
success of Windows Vista suggest that Microsoft may be working hard on the
problem.

In order to speed up as much as possible the GHASH,
the current implementation expands the 16 byte hash key
(H) into a table of 64 KBytes. However, that is sensitive
to cache-based timing attacks.

If we assume that access to data inside the same cache line
is constant-time (likely), fitting a table item into a cache
line may help against the attacks.

This patch reduce the pre-computed table from 64K to 4K
and aligns every item to a 32 byte boundary (since most modern
CPUs have cache line of that size or larger).

This patch will reduce the overall performance.

This is a corollary to the previous commit. While it was not mentioned
in the iSec report, it follows that if we apply a mitigation to the
journalist login to prevent DoS via submitting excessively long
passwords, we should do the same for the Source Interface - which, if
anything, is *more* vulnerable because it is publicly available as a
normal hidden service, not an authenticated hidden service like the
Document Interface.

The MAX_CODENAME_LEN is arbitrary, but is already far longer than the
longest possible codename given the current wordlist and maximum
codename length (10 words). I have tested to confirm that 128-character
codenames cannot trigger DoS.

I also modified the source logging to not print out the codename when
`valid_codename` returns False. In the context of this issue, this is
useful because an attacker who is sending enormously long codenames as a
DoS attempt would have those codenames printed to the log file, which
would make it extremely dificult to work with the logs. In general, this
is defense in depth - while logging for the Source Interface is disabled
in production, if it were turned on temporarily or accidentally, it
would be good to avoid logging all invalid codenames, as I would expect
that many of them would be *very* close to actual source's codenames
(except for one or two typos).

Adds a unit test to make sure `hash_codename` is not called if the
codename is over the maximum length, which prevents the DoS.

When the SSLEngine overload that accepts an array of ByteBuffers is
called with heap buffers for both the source and destination, those
heap buffers are converted to direct buffers for passing to JNI by way
of copying them to a single temporary direct buffer.  A bug in the
reading of the encrypted data out of BoringSSL resulted in the data
being placed at the wrong offset of the temporary buffer, meaning that
the output data was prefixed in the worst case by the plaintext.

This patch makes standard post-build action refuse to let you configure a downstream project you cannot currently build.
The one from parameterized-trigger will show an error in the configure screen but still lets you save the configuration; needs an analogous patch to that plugin.
Does not yet protect against POSTing config.xml with the trigger.

Temporary files were previously written to the system temporary directory
with default permissions.  A malicious actor could have captured sensitive
information by reading files from the temporary directory.  The temporary
files typically are only on the file system for the duration of a single
command line git invocation, but cloning a large git repo could require
an extended time with those sensitive files in the temporary directory.

This change sets permissions on the temporary files to be readable only by
the file owner. If a workspace is available, a temporary directory adjacent
to the workspace is used instead of the system temporary directory.",716e3ff56074c018c76cb35826269b976540e7e7,java,2.1,a5b6d798cb89d2d5a821263ad486fdd2f8fc35a6,30a01b1ccb9f5637391bf6dfa9c5a7aa3dde312e,FOUND,1466.2197543698321,1459.328468977371,6.891285392461214,582.4431995787356,578.281975452146,4.161224126589673,929.0057830210503,916.3881563728892,12.61762664816115,2304.285714285714,2280.285714285714,24.0,2605.3963963963965,2575.3963963963965,30.0,-691.4819400210641,-605.7839810000963,-85.6979590209678,3818.0,3787.0,31.0,2237.048390437488,2215.21642826666,21.831962170827865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2877.5,2846.5,31.0

Some authors use CVE-1999-0103 to refer to the kpasswd UDP ping-pong

An authenticated remote client can cause a KDC to crash by making a
valid TGS-REQ to a KDC serving a realm with a single-component name.
The process_tgs_req() function dereferences a null pointer because an
unusual failure condition causes a helper function to return success.

While attempting to provide cross-realm referrals for host-based
service principals, the find_referral_tgs() function could return a
TGS principal for a zero-length realm name (indicating that the
hostname in the service principal has no known realm associated with
it).

Subsequently, the find_alternate_tgs() function would attempt to
construct a path to this empty-string realm, and return success along
with a null pointer in its output parameter.  This happens because
krb5_walk_realm_tree() returns a list of length one when it attempts
to construct a transit path between a single-component realm and the
empty-string realm.  This list causes a loop in find_alternate_tgs()
to iterate over zero elements, resulting in the unexpected output of a
null pointer, which process_tgs_req() proceeds to dereference because
there is no error condition.

Add an error condition to find_referral_tgs() when
krb5_get_host_realm() returns an empty realm name.  Also add an error
condition to find_alternate_tgs() to handle the length-one output from
krb5_walk_realm_tree().

The vulnerable configuration is not likely to arise in practice.
(Realm names that have a single component are likely to be test
realms.)  Releases prior to krb5-1.11 are not vulnerable.

Thanks to Sol Jerome for reporting this problem.

prep_reprocess_req() can cause a null pointer dereference when
processing a service principal name.  Code in this function can

[MITKRB5-SA-2015-001] In svcauth_gss_accept_sec_context(), do not copy
bytes from the union context into the handle field we send to the
client.  We do not use this handle field, so just supply a fixed
string of ""xxxx"".

In gss_union_ctx_id_struct, remove the unused ""interposer"" field which
was causing part of the union context to remain uninitialized.

Firefox 3.7 supports a new security mechanism called Content Security
Policy (CSP) that acts as a layer to prevent XSS, CSRF and clickjacking
attacks.

We can ensure that MantisBT doesn't load any files (images, scripts,
etc) from external domains by using CSP. The exception to this rule at
the moment is the use of Gravatar for user avatar support in MantisBT.

CSP also allows us to limit the domains which can include MantisBT
within an iframe, helping prevent clickjacking attacks. At the moment we

Net.Edit0r (Net.Edit0r@Att.net) from BlACK Hat Group
[http://black-hg.org] posted a vulnerability report for an XSS issue in
search.php for MantisBT 1.2.6.

The full report is available at
http://packetstormsecurity.org/files/104149

filter_api.php is the culprit for this vulnerability as it passes user
supplied search parameters back into output without first escaping the
values.

It should be noted that numerous other XSS vulnerabilities (all related)
have been fixed with this patch. In other words, it is not just the
project_id parameter to search.php that was affected - it was numerous
other parameters/fields as well.

The second SQL injection vulnerability identified by Net.Edit0r is
invalid because the only time we ever make reference to ""mbadmin"" in the
source code is:

core.php:
if ( file_exists( 'mantis_offline.php' ) && !isset( $_GET['mbadmin'] ) )

This usage is safe because nothing is ever done with $_GET['mbadmin'].
It may be the case that the user's customised version of
mantis_offline.php was incorrectly dumping the value of $_GET['mbadmin']
to the screen. The default/sample mantis_offline.php has been checked
and does not print any dynamically created strings/user supplied values.

The Secure cookie flag is now set for all cookies when the user is
browsing via a TLS protected connection. Originally this flag was only
set for the PHP session ID cookie.

MantisBT now supports the HttpOnly cookie flag and will use it when
possible (PHP 5.2.0 is required). This flag tells the client browser to
deny Javascript access to the cookie (both reading and writing). As
such, this flag is very useful in providing another layer of protection
against XSS attacks.

The gpc_set_cookie function has an additional parameter to disable the
HttpOnly flag on a per-cookie basis. This parameter should be set to
false when sending a cookie to the client that client-side Javascript
needs to read or write.

This is a follow-up on CVE-2014-1609 / issue #16880.

Edwin Gozeling and Wim Visser from ITsec Security Services BV
(http://www.itsec.nl) discovered that the fix in #16880 did not fully
address the problem. Their research demonstrate that using a specially
crafted project id parameter, an attacker could still perform an SQL
injection.

The same issue was also reported by Paul Richards in issue #17823.

This patch fixes the problem by typecasting the Project ID parameter
to Integer.

Kacper Szurek (http://security.szurek.pl/) discovered an XSS
vulnerability in Custom fields management pages, caused by unescaped
output of 'return URL' GPC parameter. His report describes two ways to
exploit this issue:

1. using 'accesskey' inside hidden input field (see [1]) reflects XSS to
   the administrator in manage_custom_field_edit_page.php when the
   keyboard shortcut is actioned
2. using 'javascript:' URI scheme executes the code when the user clicks
   the [Proceed] link on manage_custom_field_update.php after updating
   a custom field

This commit fixes both attack vectors:

- properly escape the return URL prior to printing it on the hidden form
  field
- let html_operation_successful() sanitize the URL before displaying
  it, just like html_meta_redirect() does. In this case, if the
  string contains an URI scheme, it will be replaced by 'index.php'

As an extra safety measure following up on the fix for CVE-2017-7620, we
encode the backslashes in the 'script' part of the URL to ensure that
the sanitized URL is treated as a path relative to MantisBT root and not
a link to an external site if the URL begins with an escaped `/`.

This reduces the risk of someone being able to use the same attack
vector in another page.

Kornel Lesinski reported a significant security problem with Mantis'
handling of attachments and MIME types. A user could upload a HTML file
renamed to .gif and MantisBT would use Fileinfo to calculate the actual
MIME type to be text/html. This is a problem because a user could be
directed to click on a link purporting to be a .gif attachment when in
fact it is a HTML document. Browsers would attempt to render the
text/html attachment within the browser instead of treating it as a file
download (or even just plaintext).

Internet Explorer exaggerates this problem by ignoring the Content-Type
header so that it can perform its own analysis of the file type. With
the expectation that Fileinfo and any browser MIME detection are
inherently insecure and unpredictable, we don't want to allow users to
upload random files that *could* be misinterpreted by MIME detectors for
malicious purposes. As we send our own Content-Type headers where
appropriate, we can tell Internet Explorer 8+ to stop it's own MIME type
sniffing, resulting in a performance boost for IE8+ users.

To solve this problem, a new 'show_inline' parameter has been introduced to
file_download.php which serves the purpose of specifying whether the
file should be served to the user as an attachment (within the
Content-Disposition header) or as an inline file that can be rendered
within the browser.

This parameter has also been protected using a CSRF token to ensure that
cross-domain attacks are not possible whereby a malicious user uploads a
HTML document and sends a link to someone else with &show_inline=1 set.
This is particularly an issue where an attacker places a MantisBT
instance within an invisible iframe such that the HTML attachment is
rendered unknown to users (and this HTML attachment could invoke
JavaScript to do nasty things within the domain of the MantisBT
installation).

In summary, MantisBT will treat all attachments as file downloads when
it prepares the Content-Disposition header. An exception currently
exists for inline image previews where MantisBT will create img src URLs
that point to file_download.php with show_inline=1 and a CSRF token
parameter provided. The MIME type isn't a significant concern in this
case as browsers won't try to render HTML where an image is expected.",8bf42a625ee0d2372810acbde33be7a7fcc2aa17,['php'],,28e1c57741afa0d45294a89a4a77e5a460e2df0d,964ca1bd7df247dc63898d9f2f6957655723ec16,FOUND,-2422.672200591344,-2422.023406388012,-0.6487942033318177,-18292.774344998197,-18301.314651029847,8.54030603164938,-13972.717048346056,-13989.492667129307,16.775618783251048,-13439.964285714286,-13451.964285714286,12.0,7424.0270270270275,7409.0270270270275,15.0,-8878.156507928516,-8778.43665999488,-99.71984793363481,8719.0,8704.0,15.0,6336.363154046587,6325.447172961172,10.915981085414387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7877.5,7862.5,15.0

HTML output, thus leading to XSS issues.

The easiest workaround is to pass in already-escaped values to the
Projax functions.

Motivation:
Before we aggregated the full text in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder just to fill in the ContinuationWebSocketFrame.aggregatedText(). The problem was that there was no upper-limit and so it would be possible to see an OOME if the remote peer sends a TextWebSocketFrame + a never ending stream of ContinuationWebSocketFrames. Furthermore the aggregation does not really belong in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder, as we provide an extra ChannelHandler for this anyway (WebSocketFrameAggregator).

Modification:
Remove the ContinuationWebSocketFrame.aggregatedText() method and corresponding constructor. Also refactored WebSocket08FrameDecoder a bit to me more efficient which is now possible as we not need to aggregate here.

While BREACH requires the following three factors to be effectively exploitable we should add another mitigation:

1. Application must support HTTP compression
2. Response most reflect user-controlled input
3. Response should contain sensitive data

Especially part 2 is with ownCloud not really given since user-input is usually only echoed if a CSRF token has been passed.

To reduce the risk even further it is however sensible to encrypt the CSRF token with a shared secret.

We should verify the app versions when installing a new update, otherwise this could result in downgrade attacks when an attacker just copies the old signature.

Plus it prevents the case that in case of a bug in the appstore actually an older version gets installed.

In 1.1.0 changing the ciphersuite during a renegotiation can result in
a crash leading to a DoS attack. In master this does not occur with TLS
(instead you get an internal error, which is still wrong but not a security
issue) - but the problem still exists in the DTLS code.

The problem is caused by changing the flag indicating whether to use ETM
or not immediately on negotiation of ETM, rather than at CCS. Therefore,
during a renegotiation, if the ETM state is changing (usually due to a
change of ciphersuite), then an error/crash will occur.

Due to the fact that there are separate CCS messages for read and write

The internal |fmtstr| function used in processing a ""%s"" format string
in the BIO_*printf functions could overflow while calculating the length
of a string and cause an OOB read when printing very long strings.

Additionally the internal |doapr_outch| function can attempt to write to
an OOB memory location (at an offset from the NULL pointer) in the event of
a memory allocation failure. In 1.0.2 and below this could be caused where
the size of a buffer to be allocated is greater than INT_MAX. E.g. this
could be in processing a very long ""%s"" format string. Memory leaks can also
occur.

These issues will only occur on certain platforms where sizeof(size_t) >
sizeof(int). E.g. many 64 bit systems. The first issue may mask the second
issue dependent on compiler behaviour.

These problems could enable attacks where large amounts of untrusted data
is passed to the BIO_*printf functions. If applications use these functions
in this way then they could be vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses these
functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data. Therefore
applications that print this data could be vulnerable if the data is from
untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications could also be
vulnerable where they print out ASN.1 data, or if untrusted data is passed
as command line arguments.

Libssl is not considered directly vulnerable. Additionally certificates etc
received via remote connections via libssl are also unlikely to be able to
trigger these issues because of message size limits enforced within libssl.

An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncodeUpdate function which is used for
Base64 encoding of binary data. If an attacker is able to supply very large
amounts of input data then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap
corruption. Due to the very large amounts of data involved this will most
likely result in a crash.

Internally to OpenSSL the EVP_EncodeUpdate function is primarly used by the
PEM_write_bio* family of functions. These are mainly used within the
OpenSSL command line applications, so any application which processes
data from an untrusted source and outputs it as a PEM file should be
considered vulnerable to this issue.

User applications that call these APIs directly with large amounts of
untrusted data may also be vulnerable.

the right hand edge of the window then we verify the MAC of the record.
If MAC verification fails then we discard the record. Otherwise we mark
the record as received. If the sequence number was off the right hand edge
of the window, then we slide the window along so that the right hand edge
is in line with the newly received sequence number.

Records may arrive for future epochs, i.e. a record from after a CCS being
sent, can arrive before the CCS does if the packets get re-ordered. As we
have not yet received the CCS we are not yet in a position to decrypt or
validate the MAC of those records. OpenSSL places those records on an
unprocessed records queue. It additionally updates the window immediately,
even though we have not yet verified the MAC. This will only occur if
currently in a handshake/renegotiation.

This could be exploited by an attacker by sending a record for the next
epoch (which does not have to decrypt or have a valid MAC), with a very
large sequence number. This means the right hand edge of the window is
moved very far to the right, and all subsequent legitimate packets are
dropped causing a denial of service.

A similar effect can be achieved during the initial handshake. In this
case there is no MAC key negotiated yet. Therefore an attacker can send a
message for the current epoch with a very large sequence number. The code
will process the record as normal. If the hanshake message sequence number
(as opposed to the record sequence number that we have been talking about
so far) is in the future then the injected message is bufferred to be
handled later, but the window is still updated. Therefore all subsequent
legitimate handshake records are dropped. This aspect is not considered a
security issue because there are many ways for an attacker to disrupt the
initial handshake and prevent it from completing successfully (e.g.
injection of a handshake message will cause the Finished MAC to fail and
the handshake to be aborted). This issue comes about as a result of trying
to do replay protection, but having no integrity mechanism in place yet.
Does it even make sense to have replay protection in epoch 0? That
issue isn't addressed here though.

This addressed an OCAP Audit issue.

The SRP user database lookup method SRP_VBASE_get_by_user had confusing
memory management semantics; the returned pointer was sometimes newly
allocated, and sometimes owned by the callee. The calling code has no
way of distinguishing these two cases.

Specifically, SRP servers that configure a secret seed to hide valid
login information are vulnerable to a memory leak: an attacker
connecting with an invalid username can cause a memory leak of around
300 bytes per connection.

Servers that do not configure SRP, or configure SRP but do not configure
a seed are not vulnerable.

In Apache, the seed directive is known as SSLSRPUnknownUserSeed.

To mitigate the memory leak, the seed handling in SRP_VBASE_get_by_user
is now disabled even if the user has configured a seed.

Applications are advised to migrate to SRP_VBASE_get1_by_user. However,
note that OpenSSL makes no strong guarantees about the
indistinguishability of valid and invalid logins. In particular,
computations are currently not carried out in constant time.

An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncryptUpdate function. If an attacker is
able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to
EVP_EncryptUpdate with a partial block then a length check can overflow
resulting in a heap corruption.

Following an analysis of all OpenSSL internal usage of the
EVP_EncryptUpdate function all usage is one of two forms.

The first form is like this:
EVP_EncryptInit()
EVP_EncryptUpdate()

i.e. where the EVP_EncryptUpdate() call is known to be the first called
function after an EVP_EncryptInit(), and therefore that specific call
must be safe.

The second form is where the length passed to EVP_EncryptUpdate() can be
seen from the code to be some small value and therefore there is no
possibility of an overflow.

Since all instances are one of these two forms, I believe that there can
be no overflows in internal code due to this problem.

It should be noted that EVP_DecryptUpdate() can call EVP_EncryptUpdate()
in certain code paths. Also EVP_CipherUpdate() is a synonym for
EVP_EncryptUpdate(). Therefore I have checked all instances of these
calls too, and came to the same conclusion, i.e. there are no instances
in internal usage where an overflow could occur.

This could still represent a security issue for end user code that calls
this function directly.

DTLS can handle out of order record delivery. Additionally since
handshake messages can be bigger than will fit into a single packet, the
messages can be fragmented across multiple records (as with normal TLS).
That means that the messages can arrive mixed up, and we have to
reassemble them. We keep a queue of buffered messages that are ""from the
future"", i.e. messages we're not ready to deal with yet but have arrived
early. The messages held there may not be full yet - they could be one
or more fragments that are still in the process of being reassembled.

The code assumes that we will eventually complete the reassembly and
when that occurs the complete message is removed from the queue at the
point that we need to use it.

However, DTLS is also tolerant of packet loss. To get around that DTLS
messages can be retransmitted. If we receive a full (non-fragmented)
message from the peer after previously having received a fragment of
that message, then we ignore the message in the queue and just use the
non-fragmented version. At that point the queued message will never get
removed.

Additionally the peer could send ""future"" messages that we never get to
in order to complete the handshake. Each message has a sequence number
(starting from 0). We will accept a message fragment for the current
message sequence number, or for any sequence up to 10 into the future.
However if the Finished message has a sequence number of 2, anything
greater than that in the queue is just left there.

So, in those two ways we can end up with ""orphaned"" data in the queue
that will never get removed - except when the connection is closed. At
that point all the queues are flushed.

An attacker could seek to exploit this by filling up the queues with
lots of large messages that are never going to be used in order to
attempt a DoS by memory exhaustion.

I will assume that we are only concerned with servers here. It does not
seem reasonable to be concerned about a memory exhaustion attack on a
client. They are unlikely to process enough connections for this to be
an issue.

A ""long"" handshake with many messages might be 5 messages long (in the
incoming direction), e.g. ClientHello, Certificate, ClientKeyExchange,
CertificateVerify, Finished. So this would be message sequence numbers 0
to 4. Additionally we can buffer up to 10 messages in the future.
Therefore the maximum number of messages that an attacker could send
that could get orphaned would typically be 15.

The maximum size that a DTLS message is allowed to be is defined by
max_cert_list, which by default is 100k. Therefore the maximum amount of
""orphaned"" memory per connection is 1500k.

Message sequence numbers get reset after the Finished message, so
renegotiation will not extend the maximum number of messages that can be
orphaned per connection.

As noted above, the queues do get cleared when the connection is closed.
Therefore in order to mount an effective attack, an attacker would have
to open many simultaneous connections.

This issue is very similar to CVE-2016-6307 described in the previous
commit. The underlying defect is different but the security analysis and
impacts are the same except that it impacts DTLS.

A DTLS message includes 3 bytes for its length in the header for the
message.
This would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of this length
are excessive and OpenSSL includes a check to ensure that a peer is sending
reasonably sized messages in order to avoid too much memory being consumed
to service a connection. A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0 means that
memory for the message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive
message length check. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could
mean an attacker could force up to 21Mb to be allocated to service a
connection. This could lead to a Denial of Service through memory
exhaustion. However, the excessive message length check still takes place,
and this would cause the connection to immediately fail. Assuming that the
application calls SSL_free() on the failed conneciton in a timely manner
then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be immediately freed again.
Therefore the excessive memory allocation will be transitory in nature.
This then means that there is only a security impact if:

1) The application does not call SSL_free() in a timely manner in the
event that the connection fails
or
2) The application is working in a constrained environment where there
is very little free memory
or
3) The attacker initiates multiple connection attempts such that there
are multiple connections in a state where memory has been allocated for
the connection; SSL_free() has not yet been called; and there is
insufficient memory to service the multiple requests.

Except in the instance of (1) above any Denial Of Service is likely to
be transitory because as soon as the connection fails the memory is
subsequently freed again in the SSL_free() call. However there is an
increased risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack
of memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of Service.

This issue does not affect TLS users.

Follow on from CVE-2016-2179

The investigation and analysis of CVE-2016-2179 highlighted a related flaw.

This commit fixes a security ""near miss"" in the buffered message handling
code. Ultimately this is not currently believed to be exploitable due to
the reasons outlined below, and therefore there is no CVE for this on its
own.

The issue this commit fixes is a MITM attack where the attacker can inject
a Finished message into the handshake. In the description below it is
assumed that the attacker injects the Finished message for the server to
receive it. The attack could work equally well the other way around (i.e
where the client receives the injected Finished message).

The MITM requires the following capabilities:
- The ability to manipulate the MTU that the client selects such that it
is small enough for the client to fragment Finished messages.
- The ability to selectively drop and modify records sent from the client
- The ability to inject its own records and send them to the server

The MITM forces the client to select a small MTU such that the client
will fragment the Finished message. Ideally for the attacker the first
fragment will contain all but the last byte of the Finished message,
with the second fragment containing the final byte.

During the handshake and prior to the client sending the CCS the MITM
injects a plaintext Finished message fragment to the server containing
all but the final byte of the Finished message. The message sequence
number should be the one expected to be used for the real Finished message.

OpenSSL will recognise that the received fragment is for the future and
will buffer it for later use.

After the client sends the CCS it then sends its own Finished message in
two fragments. The MITM causes the first of these fragments to be
dropped. The OpenSSL server will then receive the second of the fragments
and reassemble the complete Finished message consisting of the MITM
fragment and the final byte from the real client.

The advantage to the attacker in injecting a Finished message is that
this provides the capability to modify other handshake messages (e.g.
the ClientHello) undetected. A difficulty for the attacker is knowing in
advance what impact any of those changes might have on the final byte of
the handshake hash that is going to be sent in the ""real"" Finished
message. In the worst case for the attacker this means that only 1 in
256 of such injection attempts will succeed.

It may be possible in some situations for the attacker to improve this such
that all attempts succeed. For example if the handshake includes client
authentication then the final message flight sent by the client will
include a Certificate. Certificates are ASN.1 objects where the signed
portion is DER encoded. The non-signed portion could be BER encoded and so
the attacker could re-encode the certificate such that the hash for the
whole handshake comes to a different value. The certificate re-encoding
would not be detectable because only the non-signed portion is changed. As
this is the final flight of messages sent from the client the attacker
knows what the complete hanshake hash value will be that the client will
send - and therefore knows what the final byte will be. Through a process
of trial and error the attacker can re-encode the certificate until the
modified handhshake also has a hash with the same final byte. This means
that when the Finished message is verified by the server it will be
correct in all cases.

In practice the MITM would need to be able to perform the same attack
against both the client and the server. If the attack is only performed
against the server (say) then the server will not detect the modified
handshake, but the client will and will abort the connection.
Fortunately, although OpenSSL is vulnerable to Finished message
injection, it is not vulnerable if *both* client and server are OpenSSL.
The reason is that OpenSSL has a hard ""floor"" for a minimum MTU size
that it will never go below. This minimum means that a Finished message
will never be sent in a fragmented form and therefore the MITM does not
have one of its pre-requisites. Therefore this could only be exploited
if using OpenSSL and some other DTLS peer that had its own and separate
Finished message injection flaw.

The fix is to ensure buffered messages are cleared on epoch change.

During certificate verfification, OpenSSL will attempt to find an

This occurs where at least one cert is added to the first chain from the

A TLS message includes 3 bytes for its length in the header for the message.
This would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of this length
are excessive and OpenSSL includes a check to ensure that a peer is sending
reasonably sized messages in order to avoid too much memory being consumed
to service a connection. A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0 means that
memory for the message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive
message length check. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could
mean an attacker could force up to 21Mb to be allocated to service a
connection. This could lead to a Denial of Service through memory
exhaustion. However, the excessive message length check still takes place,
and this would cause the connection to immediately fail. Assuming that the
application calls SSL_free() on the failed conneciton in a timely manner
then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be immediately freed again.
Therefore the excessive memory allocation will be transitory in nature.
This then means that there is only a security impact if:

1) The application does not call SSL_free() in a timely manner in the
event that the connection fails
or
2) The application is working in a constrained environment where there
is very little free memory
or
3) The attacker initiates multiple connection attempts such that there
are multiple connections in a state where memory has been allocated for
the connection; SSL_free() has not yet been called; and there is
insufficient memory to service the multiple requests.

Except in the instance of (1) above any Denial Of Service is likely to
be transitory because as soon as the connection fails the memory is
subsequently freed again in the SSL_free() call. However there is an
increased risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack
of memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of Service.

This issue does not affect DTLS users.

Related-bug: 1409142

As part of the fix for the related bug - we've added protocol checking
to mitigate MITM attacks, however we base protocol checking on a config
option that is normally only intended for compute hosts.

This is quite user hostile, as it is now important that all nodes
running compute and proxy services have this option in sync.

We can do better than that - we can persist the URL the client is
expected to use, and once we get it back on token validation, we can
make sure that the request is using the intended protocol, mitigating
the MITM injected script attacks.

This patch makes sure that the access_url is persisted with the token -
the follow-up patch makes consoles use that info.

This is especially critical since Redis supports the LUA scripting language and thus a simple SSRF vulnerability (as proven in http://benmmurphy.github.io/blog/2015/06/04/redis-eval-lua-sandbox-escape/ for example) may lead to a remote code execution.",6911d8f0a4e688f3c84f2dd117424f887820750a,['php'],,3a6b11d018e693b61cf201232bf5566f1a540b77,df2e712a8e84b3e12d5a54e3526ab996791e658e,FOUND,10021.53490301884,10021.53490301884,0.0,-288116.60905022395,-288116.60905022395,0.0,-13609.62484385843,-13609.62484385843,0.0,42055.357142857145,42055.357142857145,0.0,46191.129570747216,46191.129570747216,0.0,61435.18616590508,61435.18616590508,0.0,35217.90789473684,35217.90789473684,0.0,114284.50215002452,114284.50215002452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,102757.5,102757.5,0.0

In order to configure full SLL verification, `sslmode=verify-full` should be used.
However, previous versions of pgjdbc missed hostname verification for non-default SSL factories,
so `sslmode=verify-full` was effectively the same as `sslmode=verify-ca`.

Default sslfactory (which is LibPQFactory) is not impacted.

GD2 stores the number of horizontal and vertical chunks as words (i.e. 2
byte unsigned). These values are multiplied and assigned to an int when
reading the image, what can cause integer overflows. We have to avoid
that, and also make sure that either chunk count is actually greater
than zero. If illegal chunk counts are detected, we bail out from
reading the image.

The PHP core and extensions are written with the assumption that memory
allocation either succeeds, or the allocator bails out (i.e. the allocator
is infallible). Therefore the result of emalloc() and friends are not checked
for NULL values.

However, with USE_ZEND_ALLOC=0, malloc() and friends are used as allocators,
but these are fallible, i.e. they return NULL instead of bailing out if they
fail. This easily leads to invalid memory accesses in the following, such as
in <https://bugs.php.net/73032>. Some of these cases may constitute
exploitable vulnerabilities.

Therefore we make the infallible __zend_alloc() and friends the default for

New implementation of hashtables introduced a compaction step which is
triggered when a hashtable is full but it contains at least one deleted
bucket. Therefore there is a possibility that a cleverly crafted code can
trigger this compaction step (which takes time proportional to the size of
hashtabe) by executing constatnt number of operations. When the hashtable
is full, deletion and subsequent addition or single element triggers a
table compaction and these two steps can be repeated ad infinitum. This
might be avenue for a DOS attack.

This patch allows compaction to be performed only if the hashtable contains

Our existing libtidy support is based on the legacy ""HTML tidy""
project. That project now has a successor called tidy-html5, where all
new features and bugfixes happen. Of particular note are the fixes for
two security vulnerabilities, CVE-2015-5522 and CVE-2015-5523.

The API is largely unchanged in the new project (which is truly the
successor of the original -- not a fork), and so it is almost a
drop-in replacement as far as PHP is concerned. However, one file has
changed in the new project: ""buffio.h"" has been moved to
""tidybuffio.h"".

This commit detects the presence of tidybuffio.h at build time, and
then adjusts the import statement in tidy.c accordingly. The result is
a build that works against either the legacy project or the new
tidy-html5 project, although the test suite for the tidy extension now
fails. Those failures are not critical and will be fixed.

Primarily related to the path handling datatypes, to avoid unnecessary
casts, where possible. Also some rework to avoid code dup. Probably
more places are to go, even not path related, primarily to have less
casts and unsigned integers where possible. That way, we've not only
less warnings and casts, but are also safer with regard to the
integer overflows. OFC it's not a panacea, but still significantly

to bind a list of values in an in clause.  It was demonstrated that by allowing
that functionality you open up the possibility for certain types of
sql injection attacks.  The previous fix attempts all focused on preventing
the insertion of additional sql statements (the semi-colon problem:
xxx; any new sql statement here).  But that still left the ability to
change the where clause on the current statement or perform a subselect
which can circumvent applicaiton security logic and/or allow you to call
any stored function.

Ok, it seems that another change to the PostgreSQL large object APIs
happened in PG 9.0: large objects got ACLs. Before that, anybody could
access them. In PL/Java, anybody still can. :(

The ideal accommodation on PL/Java's side will be to retarget PL/Java's
LargeObject code from the PG inv_api.c layer to the be-fsstubs.c layer
(if something doesn't make that prohibitively difficult), because that's
where the 9.0+ access checks happen. Otherwise, the checking code needs
to be duplicated in PL/Java.

The fsstubs layer has only-good-within-one-transaction semantics.
Happily, that's all that's expected for the JDBC *LOB interfaces,
which presumably are the public API this stuff should ultimately have.

Too involved for 1.5.0. However, this is a good argument for a least-
privilege, no-public-by-default installation of the 'java' language,
documenting how GRANT USAGE can then be used to allow specific
users/roles to make PL/Java functions.

Moral: this wasn't a problem before 9.0, when everybody knew LOBs had
no access controls. It became a problem when PG added access controls
for them, and PL/Java didn't follow suit. What's a trusted language
today could need adjustments tomorrow, so no-public-usage-by-default
really seems like the best posture; the user/installer should always be
encouraged to follow the least privilege principle.",d2f6ef84e46765822f92cd8f403a7e4c1f8bb198,"['java', 'vm']",5.0,8d973b7284e9f437c1a76247ed573168dc672767,11fcc31e9401b4a96230cf959d2450d4caa6b850,FOUND,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* Made site key generation idempotent in the most crude and hackish way

h4. Site key

A Site key gives additional protection against a dictionary attack if your
DB is ever compromised.  With no site key, we store
  DB_password = hash(user_password, DB_user_salt)
If your database were to be compromised you'd be vulnerable to a dictionary
attack on all your stupid users' passwords.  With a site key, we store
  DB_password = hash(user_password, DB_user_salt, Code_site_key)
That means an attacker needs access to both your site's code *and* its
database to mount an ""offline dictionary attack"":http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/web-authentication.html

It's probably of minor importance, but recommended by best practices: 'defense
in depth'.  Needless to say, if you upload this to github or the youtubes or
otherwise place it in public view you'll kinda defeat the point.  Your users'
passwords are still secure, and the world won't end, but defense_in_depth -= 1.

Please note: if you change this, all the passwords will be invalidated, so DO
keep it someplace secure.  Use the random value given or type in the lyrics to
your favorite Jay-Z song or something; any moderately long, unpredictable text.

* Stretch

Repeated applications of the hash make brute force (even with a compromised
database and site key) harder, and scale with Moore's law.

  bq. ""To squeeze the most security out of a limited-entropy password or
  passphrase, we can use two techniques [salting and stretching]... that are so
  simple and obvious that they should be used in every password system.  There
  is really no excuse not to use them. ... Choose stretching factor so computing
  K from (salt, passwd) takes 200-1000 ms. Store r with the user's password, and
  increase it as computers get faster.-- http://tinyurl.com/37lb73
  Practical Security (Ferguson & Scheier) p350

Now, adding even a 0.2s delay to page requests isn't justifiable for most online
applications, and storing r is unnecessary (at least on your first design
iteration).  But
  On a 1G Slicehost already under moderate load:
  irb(main):005:0> puts Time.now; (10**6).times{ secure_digest(Time.now, rand) }; puts Time.now
  Fri May 16 08:26:16 +0000 2008
  Fri May 16 08:30:58 +0000 2008
  => 280s/1M ~= 0.000_3 ms / digest
A modest 10 (the default here) foldings makes brute forcing, even given the site
key and database, 10 times harder at a 3ms penalty.  An app that otherwise
serves 100 reqs/s is reduced to 78 signin reqs/s; an app that does 10reqs/s is
reduced to 9.7 signin reqs/s

Thanks to Grayson Hansard, we found and fixed some sloppy memory usage in the Nu parser.
In most Nu applications (until now), the problem didn't arise, because typically a parser
would be created once at the beginning of an application and used through its lifetime.

But in Grayson's example, Nu parsers were being created, used, and discarded repeatedly
as part of embedding Nu inside an application, and we discovered that a retain cycle was
preventing these parsers from being released.  To break the retain cycle, the ""close""
method should be called at the end of a parser's lifetime.

For example:

    NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
    // get an autoreleased parser
    id nu = [Nu parser];
    // do something with the parser
    [nu eval:[nu parse:@""YOUR CODE GOES HERE""]];
    // now close the parser
    [nu close];
    // the parser will be released with the pool

During the research conducted all the existing relations between ISO/IEC 15504-5 software development base practices and ISO/IEC 27002 security controls have been analysed and the ISO/IEC 15504 Security Extension has been developed. This extension details the changes that software companies should make in the software lifecycle processes for the successful implementation of the related security controls. To attain our research objectives, we evaluate the ISO/IEC 15504 Security Extension through case studies in a sample of software development organizations. This study follows the design science research paradigm that is based on constructive research."

 abstract = "XSLT is a popular language for implementing both presentation templates in Web applications as well as document and message converters in enterprise applications. The widespread adoption and popularity of XSLT raises the challenge of efficiently managing the evolution of significant amounts of XSLT code. This challenge calls for guidelines and tool support for developing maintainable XSLT code. In this setting, this paper addresses the following question: Can the maintainability of XSL transformations, measured in terms of code churn in the next revision of a transformation, be predicted using a combination of simple metrics? This question is studied using a dataset extracted from open-source software project repositories. An outcome of this empirical study is a set of statistical models for predicting the maintainability of XSL transformations with relatively high accuracy. In addition, by analyzing the major influencers of code churn in these models, the paper identifies guidelines for designing XSL transformations with reduced future churn."

 abstract = "Context
 Refactoring is a technique for improving the internal structure of software systems. It has a solid theoretical background while being used in development practice also. However, we lack empirical research results on the real effect of code refactoring and its application.
 Objective
 This paper presents a manually validated subset of a previously published dataset containing the refactorings extracted by the RefFinder tool, code metrics, and maintainability of 7 open-source systems. We found that RefFinder had around 27% overall average precision on the subject systems, thus our manually validated subset has substantial added value. Using the dataset, we studied several aspects of the refactored and non-refactored source code elements (classes and methods), like the differences in their maintainability and source code metrics.
 Method
 We divided the source code elements into a group containing the refactored elements and a group with non-refactored elements. We analyzed the elements’ characteristics in these groups using correlation analysis, Mann–Whitney U test and effect size measures.
 Results
 Source code elements subjected to refactorings had significantly lower maintainability than elements not affected by refactorings. Moreover, refactored elements had significantly higher size related metrics, complexity, and coupling. Also these metrics changed more significantly in the refactored elements. The results are mostly in line with our previous findings on the not validated dataset, with the difference that clone metrics had no strong connection with refactoring.
 Conclusions
 Compared to the preliminary analysis using a not validated dataset, the manually validated dataset led to more significant results, which suggests that developers find targets for refactorings based on some internal quality properties of the source code, like their size, complexity or coupling, but not clone related metrics as reported in our previous studies. They do not just use these properties for identifying targets, but also control them with refactorings."

  abstract = {A Wilcoxon one-sample signed rank test may be made when some of the observations are 0 by dropping the 0's before ranking. However, a sample can be not significantly positive while a more negative sample (obtained by decreasing each observation equally), is significantly positive by the ordinary Wilcoxon test. The reverse is also possible. Two-piece confidence regions result. A procedure for avoiding these difficulties is proposed, namely to rank the observations including the 0's, drop the ranks of the 0's, and reject the null hypothesis if the sum of the remaining negative (or positive) ranks falls in the tail of its null distribution (given the number of 0's). If observations are tied in absolute value, their ranks may be averaged before attaching signs. This changes the null distribution. A sample may be significantly positive which is not significant if the observations are increased (unequally), or if the ties are broken in any way.},

The approach uses a standardized measurement model based on the ISO/IEC 9126 definition of maintainability and source code metrics. Procedural standardization in evaluation projects further enhances the comparability of results. Individual assessments are stored in a repository that allows any system at hand to be compared to the industry-wide state of the art in code quality and maintainability. When a minimum level of software maintainability is reached, the certification body of T{\"U}V Informationstechnik GmbH issues a Trusted Product Maintainability certificate for the software product.",
